\section{Introduction}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Why modules? Reusability (even across applications), reduced code complexity.
    \item Why responsive design?
    \item Responsive Modules of today need to be context aware (thus, not very reusable [they only work in a specific layout]).
    \item What do we want and why? Modules that are responsive relative to its outer frame.
  \end{itemize}

  A module is an interchangeable and independent part of a program that typically has a single and well-defined responsibility.
  Modular programming is a technique to reduce complexity and enable reusability.
  In order for a module to be reusable it must not assume in which context it is being used.

  Responsive Web Design (RWD) is an approach to make the application design respond to the viewport size, in order to support varying devices.
  This is achieved by using CSS media queries to define conditional style rules.

  The problem is that there is no way to make a module responsive without it being context-aware, due to media queries only being able to target the viewport.
  Thus, a responsive module using element queries is layout dependent and has therefore limited reusability.

  The desired behavior of a responsive module is having its inner design responding to the size of \emph{its frame} instead of the viewport.
  Only then is a responsive module independent of its layout context.

  This can be achieved with the theoretical feature \emph{element queries} that enables conditional CSS rules by an arbitrary element size.
  This note presents a novel implementation of element queries in JavaScript, and discusses the new possibilities of GUI design.

\section{Examples of Broken RWD Today}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item MQ is not the solution to RWD. (MQ was not designed for RWD as the feature was released long before RWD)
    \item All elements adapt their inner design by the viewport width.
    \item Menu Example shows how MQ are broken.
    \item Limitations of MQ regarding font-size (em).
  \end{itemize}

  Media queries were designed to enable developers to conditionally design content by the media, such as using serif fonts when printed and sans-serif when viewed on a screen.
  Therefore, it is only applicable for RWD of non-modular static applications.
  In a world where no better solution than media queries exists for RWD, changing the layout of an application become a cumbersome task.
  
  Imagine an application that displays stock market data in various tables.
  Each table is a module, since it may be displayed in multiple views and applications.
  Each table is also responsive, so that less important columns gets hidden as the size of the table shrinks.

\section{A Solution}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Parents should decide the layout of their children, and the children should adapt their inner design accordingly.
    \item Valid language syntaxes (HTML, CSS, JS).
  \end{itemize}

\section{Why is a Native Implementation troublesome?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Performance issues.
    \item Cite Tab Atkins of RICG (he states that it is infeasible to standardize this).
  \end{itemize}

\section{A JavaScript Implementation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Why is this pragmatic? Compatability, no impact (performance, language) on apps that do not need responsive modules.
    \item Satisfies the requirements for a solution given above.
    \item Present Elq's API.
    \item Present the performance.
    \item Note drawbacks (but only drawbacks for added functionality!).
  \end{itemize}

\section{Discussion and Summary of Related Work}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Performance, APIs, Features.
    \item The mirror functionality of Elq makes it uniquely suitable for nested modules.
  \end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Production ready.
    \item Probably no standard (or not in a long time).
  \end{itemize}

% Balancing columns in a ref list is a bit of a pain because you
% either use a hack like flushend or balance, or manually insert
% a column break.  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance
% multicols doesn't work because we're already in two-column mode,
% and flushend isn't awesome, so I choose balance.  See this
% for more info: http://cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/balance.pdf

% Note that in a perfect world balance wants to be in the first
% column of the last page.

% If balance doesn't work for you, you can remove that and
